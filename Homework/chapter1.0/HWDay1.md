### Q1
In my opinion. The blockchain is a so big databse that it needs computers all over the world to store and compute it.

Different from the traditional databese, people can only use this database for adding and searching, it couldn't deleting data. As for changing the status, it depends on whether specific functions have been established 🐱‍🏍

### Q2
Smart Contract is more like a tool, running on the big database. it could help us to perform specific functions, add and serach data.

We alse could define something in smart contract to achieve the desired results.

But keep in mind that the data you adding is not changeable if there is any interface. No possible.🐱‍👓

### Q3
In flow, if we are adding data to the blockchain or changing the data state, it is **transaction**

And if we only want to searching some data, it called **script** 👣
